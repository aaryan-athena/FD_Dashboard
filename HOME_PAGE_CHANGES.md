## Project Description Integration

The home page prominently features the SteadyMatch project description:

### Main Description
"SteadyMatch is a smart fall-detection solution designed to bring safety, speed, and peace of mind to caregiving. Connected to a Raspberry Pi and powered by a 'You Only Look Once' (YOLO) model, the app instantly detects when a person falls. Within seconds, it captures and saves a 10-second video clip—five seconds before and after the incident—and alerts the primary caregiver."

### Personal Story
"The inspiration behind SteadyMatch came from a personal story—a grandfather's fall that went unnoticed. That moment highlighted a widespread problem among senior citizens: the fear of falling and the stress it brings to both residents and caregivers."

### Mission
"By combining engineering with empathy, SteadyMatch was built to make caregiving proactive rather than reactive, empowering seniors to live freely and caregivers to respond with confidence."
